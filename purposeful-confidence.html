              <h5><span>Many strategies are available…</span></h5>
              <p>The importance of purpose is well understood and studied.  As a result, there are many approaches for how to go about “finding your purpose.”  From Forbes articles to Harvard Business Review commentary, – from positive psychology’s VIA Character Institute to Simon Sinek’s “Start with Why” – we are surrounded by commentary about the role purpose plays in our lives and various paths to work out our purpose.</p>
              <em class = "quotes">The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. —Mark Twain</em>
              <p>The trouble is, despite the availability of many self-help guides, most people struggle to articulate their purpose, let alone know how to live it.  Often, this search for purpose leads to its own form of purpose-finding anxiety.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 content ps-0 ps-lg-5">
           <h5><span>…Some strategies are better than others</span></h5>
              <p>Purpose, meaning and belonging are all outcomes.  When we are able to live our lives and contribute in a way that is meaningful to us, we experience purpose.  Therefore, the question is, “How am I able to uniquely contribute?” or put differently, “What is my core gift I am meant to give the world?”
                Innate-ly supports its clients to understand their gifts, articulate their core gift, and discover how to give their core gift.

                </div>
                <h6 class ="product-descriptions">Based on the pioneering work of Bruce Anderson, founder of the Core Gift Institute, gift philosophy is founded in ancient wisdom. Bruce has invested 40 years researching and building systems and processes based on his findings fromworking with wide and diverse members of society.  From supporting individuals living on the streets to find inspiration and meaning in life to motivating members of organisations to combine their gifts to add value and build an engaging workplace, the gifts philosophy give us our unique path to follow  in our own life.  
                We can all learn to appreciate the philosophy of gifts by exploring and valuing the diversity of our past experiences and how they come to shape what we bring to our interactions today.  Every person is born with a  core gift, something innately built into who we are, strengthened over our lives through our experiences and challenges.  The notion of gifts is consistent with the modern study of positive psychology and strengths, at the same time, it goes one step further in helping individuals to articulate their core gift which (unlike strengths) is unique to each of us.  
                Whether your community is a family, a village, a workplace, a city, a state, a nation (or all of them combined) when you are clear on your core gift in life, you are able to act with purposeful confidence, walk a path that is meaningful, and live a life focused on honing your ability to give your gift.
